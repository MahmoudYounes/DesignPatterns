# Design Patterns

I am a junior software developer trying to understand best architecture and software implementation patterns hoping that this will make me a better architect/coder. hence, I decided to create this repository which contains code examples for famous design patterns that I study.

# Plan

* start with the 23 most famous design patterns from the Gang of four book.

# Contribute

if you have the same problem or want to give a fellow coder a hand then here is how to help. 
<ul>
    <li>correct the code examples if they contain any mistakes</li>
    <li>suggest a design pattern for me to study</li>
    <li>add your explaination/code example of a specific design pattern</li>
</ul>
